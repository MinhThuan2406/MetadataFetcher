    "tool_name": "PyTorch",
    "overview_description": "PyTorch is a leading open-source machine learning framework developed by Meta AI Research (FAIR), designed specifically for deep learning and artificial intelligence applications. Built with a Python-first approach, PyTorch provides tensor computation with strong GPU acceleration and dynamic neural networks through its automatic differentiation system called Autograd. First released in 2016, PyTorch has rapidly become the dominant framework for AI research and development, with over 75% of newly published deep learning research papers using PyTorch as of 2025. The framework's dynamic computation graph and intuitive design philosophy make it exceptionally well-suited for research experimentation, prototyping, and production deployment of AI applications. PyTorch's core strength lies in its eager execution model, which allows for immediate computation and debugging, making it more intuitive for developers coming from standard Python programming.",
