    "tool_name": "pandas",
    "overview_description": "Pandas is an open-source Python library designed for data manipulation and analysis. It provides data structures like Series (1D) and DataFrames (2D) to easily clean, transform, and analyze large datasets. Created by Wes McKinney in 2008, pandas is widely used by data scientists, analysts, and researchers worldwide. The library serves as the fundamental data manipulation and analysis tool for Python, providing powerful data structures and operations for working with structured data. Built on top of NumPy, it offers intuitive data manipulation capabilities and serves as the backbone for data analysis workflows in Python, enabling users to clean, transform, analyze, and visualize data efficiently.",
