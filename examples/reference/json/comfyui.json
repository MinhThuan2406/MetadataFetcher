    "tool_name": "ComfyUI",
    "overview_description": "ComfyUI is a node-based graphical user interface for Stable Diffusion and other AI image generation models, designed for advanced users who need granular control over the image generation process. Unlike traditional prompt-based interfaces, ComfyUI uses a visual workflow system where users connect nodes to create complex image generation pipelines. This approach enables sophisticated control over every aspect of the generation process, from initial prompting to post-processing and refinement.",
