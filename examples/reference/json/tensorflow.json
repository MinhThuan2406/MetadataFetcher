    "tool_name": "TensorFlow",
    "overview_description": "TensorFlow is an end-to-end open-source machine learning platform developed by Google Brain and released in 2015. It has established itself as one of the most comprehensive and mature frameworks for developing, training, and deploying machine learning models at scale. TensorFlow provides a complete ecosystem of tools, libraries, and community resources that enables researchers to advance the state-of-the-art in ML and allows developers to build and deploy ML-powered applications efficiently. TensorFlow 2.x introduced eager execution by default, making it more intuitive and Python-friendly while maintaining the powerful production capabilities that made TensorFlow 1.x popular in enterprise environments. The platform supports multiple programming languages including Python, JavaScript, C++, Java, Go, and Swift, making it accessible to developers across different technical backgrounds. The framework is particularly renowned for its production-ready deployment capabilities, comprehensive tooling ecosystem, and strong support for distributed training across multiple devices and platforms.",
