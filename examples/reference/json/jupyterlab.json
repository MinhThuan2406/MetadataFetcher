    "tool_name": "JupyterLab",
    "overview_description": "JupyterLab is the next-generation web-based interactive development environment for notebooks, code, and data, representing the future of the Project Jupyter ecosystem. Launched as the successor to the classic Jupyter Notebook interface, JupyterLab provides all the familiar building blocks of traditional notebooks—including notebook documents, terminals, text editors, file browsers, and rich outputs—within a flexible, powerful, and extensible user interface. Built on modern web technologies, JupyterLab offers a comprehensive integrated development environment (IDE) that enables data scientists, researchers, and analysts to work with multiple documents and activities simultaneously in a single browser tab. The platform's modular architecture allows users to arrange workflows in data science, scientific computing, computational journalism, and machine learning according to their specific needs.",
