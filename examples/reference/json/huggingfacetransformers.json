    "tool_name": "Hugging Face Transformers",
    "overview_description": "Hugging Face Transformers is the leading open-source library for state-of-the-art natural language processing, computer vision, and audio processing models. The library provides thousands of pre-trained models that can be easily fine-tuned and deployed for various tasks including text classification, question answering, summarization, translation, and image recognition. With over 100,000 GitHub stars, it has become the de facto standard for working with transformer models in both research and production environments.",
