    "tool_name": "Python",
    "overview_description": "Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language that has become the dominant choice for artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data science applications in 2025. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python emphasizes code readability through its design philosophy of significant indentation and clean syntax. As a dynamically typed and interpreted language, Python supports multiple programming paradigms including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming. Its extensive standard library, massive ecosystem of third-party packages, and active global community have made it the most popular programming language for AI/ML development.",
