    "tool_name": "Jupyter Notebook",
    "overview_description": "Jupyter Notebook is the original web-based interactive computational environment that revolutionized data science workflows and collaborative research. As the predecessor to JupyterLab, Jupyter Notebook provides a document-centric interface that enables users to create and share documents containing live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text. The platform combines the power of interactive computing with the simplicity of document creation, making it an essential tool for data scientists, researchers, educators, and analysts worldwide. Originally evolved from the IPython Notebook project, Jupyter Notebook has maintained its focus on providing a streamlined, accessible interface for interactive computing. The classic notebook interface opens each notebook document in a separate browser tab, offering a familiar and intuitive environment that prioritizes simplicity and ease of use. With Notebook 7.x, the platform has been modernized with updated components while preserving the beloved document-focused experience that made it so popular.",
