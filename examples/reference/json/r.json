    "tool_name": "R (Programming Language)",
    "overview_description": "R is a free, open-source programming language and environment for statistical computing and graphics. It's a GNU project similar to the S language, designed around a true computer language that allows users to add additional functionality by defining new functions. R is widely used for data analysis, statistical modeling, and data visualization. Created by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman, R provides comprehensive statistical analysis capabilities with extensive package ecosystem through CRAN (Comprehensive R Archive Network). The language excels at data manipulation, statistical modeling, and creating publication-quality graphics.",
